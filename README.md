# CFMIP_LidarRadar
Zonal cloud and hydrometeor plots comparing COSP Lidar and Radar with CALIPSO-GOCCP and CloudSat.

The zonal plots show cloud fraction as determined by the lidar in CALIPSO GOCCP observations,
model with lidar simulator and the model itself. Similarly, the hydrometeor fraction as determined by
CloudSat and the radar simulator.
